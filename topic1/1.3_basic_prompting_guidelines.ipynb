A **playground** is a better vibe coding interface than an API, especially because you'll likely need several iterations to polish the code. Unless you use an AI-powered IDE such as **Cursor**, of course.\n",

        "  \"I need a chatbot\" is too vague, and the results will be unpredictable. Describe how the user will be interacting with the chatbot. Explain which parameters to set up in the constructor. Choose whether you want a function or a class and clearly communicate this. Decide how exceptions should be treated.\n",

        "  Some of the LLMs will be all too earger to create many things you don't ask them - a productionalizing framework, a chatbot factory, examples of usage etc. Without proper guidance, they can swamp you in code. To avoid this, you may add very insistently that you only want the chatbot class/function and nothing else.\n",

        "  Since we're working in Jupyter, LLMs may annoy you much by creating usage examples that require command line execution. Explaining how you are going to work with the code might help with that.\n",

        "2. **Provide code examples**\n",
        "\n",
        "  If you're ok with the design of `answer_with_llm` and if you want the new class or function to have a similar interface, provide its implementation. LLMs are usually good at reproducing design patterns.\n",
